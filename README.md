## Installation

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   First, clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/harshit1142/e-commerce.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   Change your current directory to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd e-commerce
   ```

3. **Install the dependencies:**
   Install all the required dependencies using npm:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   This command will read the `package.json` file and install all the listed dependencies.

4. **Start the development server:**
   Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   This will start the application in development mode and open it in your default web browser. The app will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

5. **Build the project for production:**
   To create an optimized production build of the application, run:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   This will create a `build` folder containing the production-ready files.

6. **Run tests:**
   To run the tests for the application, use:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```
   This will launch the test runner in interactive watch mode.

7. **Eject the configuration (optional):**
   If you need to customize the configuration, you can eject it by running:
   ```bash
   npm run eject
   ```
   **Note:** This is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!
